# Google Doc Clone: Collaborative Document Editing App

This project is a MERN stack application that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time. The app is inspired by Google Docs and implemented using React, Socket.IO, and Quill for real-time synchronization.

## Server Setup

1. Go to the `server` directory.
2. Install the dependencies using the command `npm install`.
3. Start the server using the command `npm start`.

## Client Setup

1. Go to the `client` directory.
2. Install the dependencies using the command `npm install`.
3. Start the client using the command `npm start`.

## How to use the Application

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
2. Share the document URL with your collaborators to invite them to the document.
3. You can edit the document, and the changes will be reflected in real-time for all collaborators.

Please note that this is a basic MERN stack project and you might need to modify the code to meet your specific requirements.
